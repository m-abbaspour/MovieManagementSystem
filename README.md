# Movie-Management-System

This program is a modificaton for th prev. program. 

This modificaton program allows Jim's Movie Manager
program to work with a relational database system.
The appropriate SQL statements will be sent to and 
executed on the database. Depending on the query 
being performed, the proper method is to be used. 
If records are retrieved, they will be displayed to 
the user. 

Any exceptions that occur because of queries will 
be handled.

Movies will be retrieved and persisted to the database 
on-demand. This means they will not be loaded into 
memory when the program starts and saved from memory 
to the database when the program ends. 


Program defects: This application cannot add mvies that
have special characters in their name to the database
(special charachters such as: ' and "
